</a>

**...an open-source implementation of the [Thread](http://threadgroup.org/technology/ourtechnology) networking protocol.** Nest has released OpenThread to make the technology used in Nest products more broadly available to developers to accelerate the development of products for the connected home.

**...OS and platform agnostic**, with a narrow platform abstraction layer and a small memory footprint, making it highly portable. It supports both system-on-chip (SoC) and network co-processor (NCP) designs.

**...a Thread Certified Component**, implementing all features defined in the [Thread 1.1.1 specification](http://threadgroup.org/technology/ourtechnology#specifications), including all Thread networking layers (IPv6, 6LoWPAN, IEEE 802.15.4 with MAC security, Mesh Link Establishment, Mesh Routing) and device roles, as well as [Border Router](https://github.com/openthread/borderrouter) support.

**All end-user documentation and guides are located at [openthread.io](https://openthread.io).**
